\## About DFIR Journey



I’m \*\*Luis Camacho Jr\*\*, a career-changer moving into Digital Forensics \& Incident Response (DFIR).



This site tracks my progression from:

\- Learning the fundamentals (Windows forensics, memory analysis, network hunting), to  

\- Designing and shipping my own tools and workflows, including \*\*ForenSynth AI\*\*.



\### How I build



Most of the code behind these projects was created using an AI-assisted workflow:



\- I design the \*\*pipeline, logic, and requirements\*\*.

\- I “vibe code” with ChatGPT to generate and iterate on the Python.

\- I test, break, and refine everything in my own lab (VMs, Sysmon, Chainsaw, Sigma, etc.).



The philosophy is simple:



> \*\*Human-led, AI-assisted.\*\* Models help surface patterns and draft summaries; the analyst makes the call.



\### Current focus



Right now I’m focused on:



\- Building \*\*repeatable DFIR pipelines\*\* (Sysmon → Chainsaw/Sigma → JSON → ForenSynth AI).

\- Publishing \*\*public artifacts\*\* — reports, markdown, screenshots — so others can review and critique my work.

\- Growing into a role where this kind of structured, lab-driven thinking is my day job.
