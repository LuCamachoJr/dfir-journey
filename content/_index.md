Welcome to \*\*DFIR Journey\*\* — my ongoing lab notebook as I transition into Digital Forensics \& Incident Response.



## This site documents:



- 🔬 **Hands-on labs:** Windows event log hunting, Sysmon telemetry, Chainsaw + Sigma workflows.  

- 🤖 **AI-augmented tools:** ForenSynth AI, a DFIR report generator I architected and built using “vibe coding” with ChatGPT.  

- 🧪 **Simulation tooling:** A Random DFIR Noise Simulator to create realistic, safe Windows activity for tuning detections.



I use this space to turn real lab work into public artifacts: write-ups, screenshots, and GitHub repos that show how I think, not just what I’ve read.
