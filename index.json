[{"content":" Automation shouldn’t replace judgment; it should buy you time to use it.\nProblem DFIR analysts burn hours turning raw detections into readable narratives. EVTX hunts surface signals, but write-ups lag behind, delaying remediation and weakening portfolio proof. We need a repeatable way to go from logs → findings → human-ready report without sacrificing accuracy or analyst judgment.\nApproach Small pipeline: Chainsaw (Sigma EVTX hunting) → SwiftOnSecurity Sysmon config (clean telemetry) → PowerShell simulator (lab noise) → Python LLM summarizer (structured narrative + IOC table). Human stays in the loop for validation and context, not rote drafting.\nHow It Works Collect EVTX from a Windows lab with Sysmon (SwiftOnSecurity config). Hunt with Chainsaw using Sigma rules; export JSON. Parse detections (technique, evidence, timestamps, host/user). Feed concise, structured chunks to the Python LLM script. Generate a narrative organized by MITRE tactics, plus IOC and timeline sections. Analyst verifies, annotates caveats, and adds reproduction steps. Output One report per run: executive summary, technique table, evidence snippets, IOC list, minimal timeline, and How to Reproduce steps. Export to Markdown and PDF. Link back to case folder, rulesets, and scripts for transparency.\nGuardrails Spot-check raw detections, confirm artifacts, and mark assumptions. Deterministic prompts (schemas), pin tool versions, and log run metadata. Document limitations (false positives, lab constraints). Credit: Chainsaw + SwiftOnSecurity; note local config tweaks.
